# TinyDFPlayer - MP3-Player based on ATtiny85 and DFPlayerMini
ATtiny controlled and LiPo battery powered MP3-Player using the DFPlayerMini-module featuring:
- Micro-SD-card slot,
- battery charging and protection circuit,
- battery level detection,
- OLED display,
- on/off switch,
- volume control,
- 3 push buttons to control the player.

You can directly connect a 3.7V LiPo battery and a 3W/4Ohm speaker to the board.
The firmware is written for the folder-play function of the DFPlayer. This means you have to create folders named 01, 02, 03, ... in the sd-card root and inside the folders you have to name the audio files 001.mp3, 002.mp3, ...
